# csc494

This is my repo for notes I've taken for my CSC494 project on augmenting Nested Cages with IPC.

## Notes on relevant papers

- [Nested Cages](nested cages)
- [Incremental Potential Contact](incremental potential contact)

## (Proposed) Timeline

need guidance on this timeline !

| Date   | Code/Implementation goal                                     | Notes/Understanding goal                                     |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Sep 27 | functions decided and implementation planned for nested cages (headers created) | notes on IPC contact model, contact mechanics, friction forces |
| Oct 4  | implementation for nested cages flow done                    | notes on IPC distance computation                            |
| Oct 11 | implementation for nested cages done aside from contact      |                                                              |
| Oct 18 | start implementing IPC                                       |                                                              |
| Nov 8  | finish implementing IPC? who knows                           |                                                              |
